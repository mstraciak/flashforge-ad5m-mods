How to connect any usb camera to camera port on LCD:
1) on LCD is camera port as "USB_CAMERA" and mark +5V, N (neative data), P (positive data), GND.
2) make short cable with connector for port on LCD and USB-A female. If you need a connector, buy a 5 pin JST PH 2.0mm female
3) just connect any usb camera to this new usb port and enable it on LCD.
   now you can use camera and usb stick at the same time.
